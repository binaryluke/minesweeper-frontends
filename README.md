# Minesweeper frontends

Frontends in various frameworks for the [Minesweeper library](https://github.com/binaryluke/Minesweeper), which I also wrote. They have been written as coding samples, and as an easy way to experiment with emerging frameworks.

## Demos

You can see a live demo of the [React Edition](http://lukehoward.name/minesweeper/react), [Angular Edition](http://lukehoward.name/minesweeper/angular) and [jQuery Edition](http://lukehoward.name/minesweeper/jquery).

## Learn

The code is free and open-source under the MIT license, so feel free to use it in any way you like.  Whether that be in your own learning projects, in learning materials you put together for others, or in a published Minesweeper clone.
